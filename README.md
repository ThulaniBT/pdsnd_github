### Project Title
Explore-Bikeshare-Data for Data Science

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The bikshare_2.py file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. Descriptive statistics is produced.
